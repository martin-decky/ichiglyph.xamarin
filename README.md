# Ichiglyph mobile interpreter

This is a simple mobile interpreter for the [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck)
and [Ichiglyph](https://github.com/martin-decky/ichiglyph) languages. It is
essentially a useless toy aspiring for world domination :) More seriously,
it is a learning and experimentation vehicle.

Both Ichiglyph and Brainfuck implement the same set of instructions, the
only major difference is their encoding. The Ichiglyph language was inspired
by a remark by Josefina Mádrová, who cleverly noted that using the
characters `l`, `I` and `1` in identifiers is a bad practice.
